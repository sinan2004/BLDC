The project to implement basic commutation of BLDC motor via X-NUCLEO-IHM07M1 , a Three-phase brushless DC motor driver expansion board based on L6230 for
STM32 Nucleo. All the pins we used are selected on the basis of datasheet proviede by STmicroelectronics. We used microcontroller based on  stm32F401RE.
